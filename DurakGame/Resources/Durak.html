		<b> Durak Rules </b>
		<ol>
		<li>There are no winners only a loser, the Durak(fool)</li>
		<li>The objective of the game is to get rid of your hand so that you the player does not become the durak. The durak is the last<br/> 
		player with cards left in their hands and they are the loser.</li>
		<li>Durak can be played with 3 decks:
			<ul>
			<li>A deck of 36, the cards ranking high to low: ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.</li>
			<li>A deck of 20, the cards ranking high to low: ace, king, queen, jack, 10.</li>
			<li>And a standard deck of 52 cards ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Each player is given 6 cards</li>
		<li>Once all the players have cards the next card in the deck is flipped over and the suit of that card is the trump.</li>
		<li>The trump is basically the best cards in the game and can beat any other card except for another trump card that is a higher level.</li>
		<li>This game is about attacking and defending, game goes in the clockwise order and the dealer starts</li>
		<li>The attacker may be helped by other players</li>
		<li>The defender can not be help by anyone</li>
		<li>The attacker begins by playing any card from hand face up on the table in front of the defender.</li>
		<li>To beat off the attack the defender will have to beat this and all subsequent attacking cards.</li>
		<li>If the defender wins 6 battles or doesn't have any cards left, they have successfully defended the attack and the cards are put<br/> 
		into the discard pile, but if the defender can not defend the attack the attack will be successful and all the cards involved in <br/>
		that battle will be picked up by the defender</li>.
		<li>Whenever an attack or defend is successful any player that does not have 6 cards must pick up cards until they have 6 cards in their<br/> 
		hand in a clock wise order.</li>
		<li>If there is no cards left in the talon(deck) any players still needs a card must pick up the trump card.</li>
		<li>Once there is no cards left in the talon and a player runs out of cards they are out of the game and safe from becoming durak</li>
		<li>The game is over when there is only one player with cards left in their hands, they are the durak.</li>
		</ol>
